I'll update this to something more useful some day. For now, this is 
what you need to do:

	make -f Makefile.cvs
	./configure
	make
	su - root
	make install

Personally I use unsermake. Even though it *must* work with GNU make, you make
get better results, especially if you have multiple processors, with unsermake:

	unsermake -f Makefile.cvs
	./configure
	unsermake
	su - root
	unsermake install

That's it.
